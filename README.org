* Opine
Opine is an OCaml library that unparses the python AST produced by
pyre-ast library back to python source code.

** Why would this be useful?
I find this to be useful to do large scale python code transformations
in OCaml.

** Can this be done in Python itself?
Yes. But if you are looking for an OCaml library to do this, you
probably already know why you are looking. Maybe this will help. I
needed something like this to maintain python source code transformations.

** How it works?
Fairly simple. The pyre-ast module provides a concrete AST
representation of the python AST. The unparse module walks through the
ast recursively while maintaining some state information and converts
the AST back to python code. It doesn't use the visitor pattern.
Everything is pure, simple functions.

** How to run?
#+begin_src bash
dune exec opine -- module expr.py
#+end_src
